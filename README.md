# pacman

This is my first repository.

My class is right now learning Javascript and one of our projects was to make pacman move, using the setinterval of 200ms, creating a run function with the arguments directions, pos, imgwidth, and pagewidth.

I was able to make my pacman move, however it still needs work since it is only moving from side to side instead of forward and reverse.

I have some bugs to work out, that I believe has to do with my if statement in the program that I will work out.
